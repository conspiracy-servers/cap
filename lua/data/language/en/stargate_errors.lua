sg_err_10 = You have both the Github version and the workshop version of cap_resources installed.<br>Please remove one of both by removing the cap_resources folder manually in your addon folder or by unsubscribing from the workshop collection.
sg_err_11 =[[ The custom fonts can not be found on your Garry's Mod Installation. Please download the following file from our site and make sure you've installed the files correctly:
<br>
<br><u>http://sg-carterpack.com/data/cap_fonts.zip</u>
<br>
<br>To install this, simply unzip the content by extracting the content with windows explorer or by pressing extract here with winrar, make sure you do not press extract to cap_fonts as that will create a folder within a folder! So double check that inside the folder there is an addon.txt and a resource file present.
<br>After it has been properly extracted place the cap_fonts folder inside “Steam\steamapps\COMMON\GarrysMod\garrysmod\addons”
<br>After this you're good to go and have CAP fully Installed!
<br>
<br>The reason why you need to download these fonts separated is that the GMA workshop file type doesn't function with custom fonts which is a Steam/GMOD error which we as addon creators can't change or find a workaround for.
